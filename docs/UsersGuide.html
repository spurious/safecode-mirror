The SAFECode compiler is a memory safety compiler built using the LLVM Compiler
Infrastructure and the Clang compiler driver.  A memory safety compiler is a
compiler that inserts run-time checks into a program during compilation to
catch memory safety errors at run-time.  Such errors can include buffer
overflows, invalid frees, and dangling pointer dereferences.
</p>

<p>
With additional instrumentation to track debugging information, a memory safety
compiler can be used to find and diagnose memory safety errors in programs
(this functionality is similar to what
<a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> does).
</p>

<p>
This manual will show how to compile a program with the SAFECode compiler and
how to read the diagnostic output when a memory safety error occurs.

<p>
The easiest way to use SAFECode is to use the modified version of Clang that
comes in the SAFECode distribution.  When used in this way, the SAFECode
transforms are performed transparently by the Clang compiler.
</p>

<p>
To activate the SAFECode transforms during compilation, add the
<i>-memsafety</i> command-line option to the Clang command line:

<ul>
  <li><tt>clang -g -memsafety -c -o <i>file.o</i> <i>file.c</i></tt></li>
</ul>

... and add the SAFECode libraries to the link command line (note that you may
need a <tt>-L</tt> option to indicate where the libraries are located:

<ul>
  <li><tt>clang -memsafety -o <i>file</i> <i>file1.o</i> <i>file2.o</i> ...
  -lsc_dbg_rt -lpoolalloc_bitmap -lstdc++</tt></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
That's it!  Note the use of the <tt>-g</tt> option; that generates debugging
information that the SAFECode transforms can use to enhance its run-time
checks.
</p>

<p>
To configure an autoconf-based software package to use SAFECode, do
the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Set the environment variable CC to $PREFIX/clang.</li>
<li> Set the environment variable CXX to $PREFIX/clang++.</li>
<li> Set the environment variable CFLAGS to "-g -memsafety"</li>
<li> Set the environment variable LDFLAGS to
     "-L$SAFECODE/$CONFIG/lib -lsc_dbg_rt -lpoolalloc_bitmap -lstdc++" where:
    <ol>
    <li> $SAFECODE is the root of the SAFECode object tree.</li>
    <li> $CONFIG is the type of build (Debug, Release, or Profile).</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li> Run the configure script</li>
<li> Type "make" to compile the source code.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Let's say that we have the following C program:
</p>

<pre>
  1 #include "stdio.h"
  2 #include "stdlib.h"
  3 
  4 int
  5 foo (char * bar) {
  6   for (unsigned index = 0; index < 10; ++index)
  7     bar[index] = 'a';
  8   return 0;
  9 }
 10 
 11 int
 12 main (int argc, char ** argv) {
 13   char * array[100];
 14   int max = atoi (argv[1]);
 15 
 16   for (int index = max; index >= 0; --index) {
 17     array[index] = malloc (index+1);
 18   }
 19 
 20   for (int index = max; index >= 0; --index) {
 21     foo (array[index]);
 22   }
 23 
 24   exit (0);
 25 }
</pre>

<p>
Lines 16-18 allocate character arrays of decreasing size, starting with the
argument plus one specified by the user down to an array of one character.
Lines 20-22 then call the function <tt>foo()</tt> which accesses elements 0-9
of the array.
</p>

<p>
If we compile this program with SAFECode and execute it:
<ul>
  <li><tt>clang -g -memsafety -o <i>test</i> <i>test.c</i></tt></li>
  <li><tt>./test 10</tt></li>
</ul>

We'll get the following error report:
</p>

<pre>
=======+++++++    SAFECODE RUNTIME ALERT +++++++=======
= Error type                            :       Load/Store Error
= Faulting pointer                      :       0x100100679
= Program counter                       :       0x100002fa6
= Fault PC Source                       :       /Users/criswell/tmp/safecode/test/test.c:7
=
= Object allocated at PC                :       0x100003600
= Allocated in Source File              :       main:1
= Object allocation sequence number     :       3
= Object start                          :       0x100100670
= Object length                         :       0x9
</pre>

<p>
The first thing to note is the error type.  SAFECode is reporting a load/store
error, meaning that some memory access is trying to access a memory location
that it should not.  The second thing to note is the faulting pointer field
(<tt>0x100100679</tt>) which tells us the pointer value that was invalid.
SAFECode reports that the error occured on line 7 of test.c; this is what we
expect because that is the line in <tt>foo()</tt> that accesses out-of-bounds
memory.
</p>

<p>
Now look at the "Object start" and "Object length" fields in the report:
</p>

<pre>
= Object start                          :       0x100100670
= Object length                         :       0x9
</pre>

<p>
Because this is a load/store error, SAFECode is telling us that a pointer
started out within the bounds of the memory object starting at 0x100100670 with
length 0x9 but that it went out of bounds to 0x100100679 and was subsequently
dereferenced.  SAFECode can do this using a technique called pointer rewriting;
when a pointer goes out of bounds, SAFECode changes it to point to a reserved,
unmapped region in the program's virtual address space.  SAFECode tracks enough
metadata about memory objects that if it ever detects a dereference of a
rewritten pointer (like the example above), it can report the bounds of the
original object from which the pointer came.  Not only that, it attempts to
print the source line information about the location at which the memory object
was allocated:

<pre>
= Allocated in Source File              :       main:1
</pre>

Unfortunately, in this example, SAFECode can't find enough debugging
information to report the source line information, so it print the function
which allocated the memory object and a unique tag for the allocation site as
a second-best result.
</p>

<p>
Finally, notice the allocation sequence number:
</p>

<pre>
= Object allocation sequence number     :       3
</pre>

<p>
A particular source line may be executed multiple times and allocate many
objects.  The sequence number above tells us that the memory object was the
third memory object allocated at the allocation site in <tt>main()</tt>.  This
information could be used, for example, to set a breakpoint at the memory
allocation site that doesn't trigger until the memory object experiencing the
error is actually allocated.
